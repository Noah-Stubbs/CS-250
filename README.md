How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
 
  User stories transmute abstract ideas/wishes from the user/stakeholders into actionable goals for the development team. They help interpret needs not as technical features, but as real problems to solve. By focusing on "what problem am I solving," I stay grounded in functionality that actually serves users, not just what's technically interesting or easy to implement.




How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 
  I approach development through iterative planning and frequent reassessment. Agile techniques like sprint planning, backlog grooming, and sprint retrospectives help keep a structure. However, as my future development work will be solo, many of the processes like user stories, task boards, and regular check-ins aren't as applicable. 




What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
 
  It all consolidates into communication and respect. 
  
  Communication is vital for unit cohesion. While this is mainly referring to team member-to-team member, it also applies in documentation. Though, I do believe there's such thing as too much documentation. The more there is, the less people will read. Also, Robert Martin's whole book "clean code" is about how the code you write should be so clear it communicates what it does. Lengthy comments and documentation is often redundant. Writing clean code is another form of communication. 
  
  Respect is also vital for unit cohesion, but also just a good trait to embody throughout all of life. A team goes much further, much faster, when deadlines are respected, honest feedback is given, and members choose to be polite and empathetic vice  hostile, degrading, and/or patronizing.
